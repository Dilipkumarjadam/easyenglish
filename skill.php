       <h1><br> Use these top tips to make your language richer:</h1>
<p>
<h1>1.      Find friends who want to speak in English:</h1> If you are surrounded by English speaking people day after day, will it improve your spoken English? The answer is yes! That’s what an environment of English does. The more your exposure to the language, the more you will be able to absorb. If you find friends who want to learn English too, you will learn from each other. Soon, you will be looking for new sentence structures and vocabulary to convey your ideas. Look around for friends like you and ways to communicate in English to raise the level of your language. Say, for example, if you and a friend decide to work together on how to ask for directions, both of you will learn new vocabulary on how to ask for directions in English. More importantly, both of you will practice the language together and listen to each other speaking. This will be helpful as communication is a two-way process. You have to listen to the language and speak it. It will always be useful to practice both the parts together.

<h1>2.      Read aloud to yourself:</h1>  In order to tell yourself that you can speak the language well, you have to hear yourself speak first! A very good way of doing this is by reading aloud English from books, magazines and newspapers to yourself. This might sound like something primary school children would do, but it works.  You can pick up the day’s newspaper and read the news articles that catch your attention. Sports lovers can go straight to the sports pages and start reading an article on their favourite sport. It will definitely retain interest while keeping you updated on the latest happenings in the world of your favourite sport. Reading loudly to yourself for ten minutes every day will convince you that you can speak fluent English!  This feeling will continue even when you try to speak with another person. When you read out the language, you will also be exposed to the new structures and vocabulary that you read. These will gently make way into your own language.

<h1>3.      Listen to the language:</h1> Listening and comprehending is key to developing your communicative ability in the English. Subscribe to podcasts and audio books to practice the receptive skill of listening. Listening to audio books is an effective method of exposing yourself to correct pronunciation. It also helps you understand the stress and intonation in words and sentences. Audio books are available for most of the books available in the market. The best part about listening to an audio book or podcast is that you only need your cell phone for it. You can download the book on your cell phone and listen to it anytime you want. This can be especially useful when you are travelling to and from work. Since communication is a two-way process, one needs to listen and understand before one speaks. Many available podcasts are not only informative but also educative. You can choose from a wide variety available today on every topic under the Sun. The basis of your choice can be topics which interest you. Ask a cricket fan to speak on cricket, and he will be able to speak for hours on the topic! If you pick topics which interest you, you will stay interested.

<h1>4.      Maintain a vocabulary book:</h1>  How do you increase your vocabulary and retain new words learnt? You can do this by maintaining a record of any new words you come across by entering them into a vocabulary book. Note down the word, its meaning and its use in a sentence. Flip through this book often, and you will find yourself using those words while speaking. Look for new words that you can use to express yourself. Target using a few of those words every day and watch your vocabulary expand. There are many words we use every day whose meaning we are unsure of. It will help to look up some of these words in the dictionary and note down these words in the vocabulary book as well. This book will serve as your own, personal dictionary, which will come to your help whenever you like a word and are looking for a place to save it. A hand-written vocabulary book will always be much more useful to you as you will have slowly filled it in word-by-word with words that you had a need to use or understand.

<h1>5.      Practice the skill of summarising: </h1> Stating the main ideas of a given passage or paragraph is known as summarising. What has been read is a great way of producing original and creative language. After reading a chapter of a book or listening to a podcast, note down the main ideas from the piece, which you can summarise in a pre-decided number of sentences. Challenge yourself by increasing or decreasing the number of sentences you can use for the summary. Then, speak out these sentences by elaborating upon the main ideas. When you try to talk about what you have read in your own words, you will be making your own sentences. This will also get you to look for new ways to express a certain idea, which will go a long way in helping build your ability to express yourself.  Do this activity with an equally-interested learner and give each other feedback on it later. When you give feedback to each other, you will be able to observe and learn from the errors of the other person. This will work towards improving your own power of expression. You can do this by speaking aloud to yourself as well.

<h1>6.      Explore language-learning apps:</h1>Language-learning apps are a great way to practice English when you are on the move. Download an app from a reliable source and use it while travelling. You will make good use of your time to learn language while building your skills.  Many of these apps explain the use of certain words and phrases and then ask you to make sentences around them. They also give real-time situations where you would need to know the language in certain role-plays or activities. Use them to build your accuracy while working on your power of expression to convey ideas. These apps also have interactive video and audio clips which help to build interest. The colourful interface makes it eye-catching which makes the user come back for more.

<h1>7.      Record your voice:</h1>  Listening to yourself speak is a fabulous way of correcting your pronunciation and reviewing your language. Give yourself a topic and speak extempore for two minutes. Record yourself when you speak and play it back to yourself. You will be able to identify pronunciation errors and evaluate your language, which can go a long way in figuring out your areas of strength. You will also be able to understand the areas you need to work on more. You can start this by first reading out articles from newspapers or books and recording them. When you get comfortable with listening to your own voice, you can start speaking on a topic you choose. Pick a variety of topics for this activity- ranging from the exciting to the boring. Sometimes, it is fun to pick up a topic which does not interest you at all. When you record your speech on such a topic, you will observe changes in intonation and speed of speech based on your interest in the topic!

<h1>8.      Read a book:</h1> What kind of stories do you prefer? Do you like adventure or suspense? Comedy or horror? There are books available on every genre. If you pick up a book that interests you, you will find that you are able to learn the language and engage yourself in an area of significance. Books can be very interesting if you like what you are reading. While reading, you will come across some new words which you can make a note of in your vocabulary book. The good part about learning new words while reading is that you can see the word being used in a sentence, which helps you understand the usage of that word. While reading, one tends to learn English without consciously trying. Take, for example, a suspense novel. When you are deeply involved in the plot of a story, the only thing that will interest you is what happens next. This is the most natural way to learn a language, so start reading a book and watch your vocabulary grow.

<h1>9.      Watch television shows in English:</h1> Watching shows will not only make you listen to the correct pronunciation of words but also will make you aware of the ways each word in a sentence is pronounced in a natural setting. Language is the most useful when its usage is understood in the correct context. The advantage of watching a show is that you also get a video that you can watch, and this helps to retain interest. The only challenge in watching a show in English is, people often select watching the sub-titles of the part. If a person is reading the subtitles while watching a video, he is not practicing the skill of listening anymore. He is practicing the skill of reading. In a nutshell, it is important to keep the subtitles off while watching your favourite show in English as this will not help you in developing your skills of listening. Try to watch English shows which have more neutral accents so that you don’t have to struggle too much to understand the accent.

<h1>10.  Keep a time to study English:</h1>Keeping a regular time every day for English studies will help you in ensuring that you are working every day towards your language goal. Consistency is a very important factor in making sure that you are working on a regular basis to improve your language. You can fix days on which you will work on different elements of the language, like adding more words to your vocabulary book or learning to use a new tense. When you make a schedule for such activities, you will make sure that all parts of English are developing at the same time. This will help you in developing all the skills of the language together. Doing this will also build your confidence in using the language as you will keep learning new concepts and vocabulary which you can then use in your language. When you use a new tense you have learnt, it will also make you want to learn of the other tenses and the times that you can use them. There are so many different concepts in a language that you will always be left with a curiosity to learn more, which will keep you motivated enough to keep looking for new ways to develop your English speaking skills.

                    <h1><br>9 English Grammar Rules to Remember</h1>
                    <h1>One of the most difficult things about learning a new language is learning the grammar rules. And while English grammar can seem quite easy compared to some languages, a small mistake can easily change the meaning of what you want to say.
So here’s a list of some important rules that you should keep in mind when you speak and write English.</h1>
                    <h1>1. Adjectives and adverbs</h1>
<p>Make sure you use adjectives and adverbs correctly. Adjectives describe, identify and quantify people or things and usually go in front of a noun. They don’t change if the noun is plural. Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs and usually come after the verb. For example:</p>
<li>
He’s a slow driver. (adjective)
</li>
<li>
He drives slowly. (adverb)
</li>

<p>Most adverbs are created by adding -ly to an adjective as in the example, but a few adverbs are irregular, such as:

<li>fast (adjective) – fast (adverb)</li>

<li>hard (adjective) – hard (adverb)</li>

<li>good (adjective) – well (adverb)</li>

For example, Your English is good. You speak English well.</p>


<h1>2. Pay attention to homophones</h1>
<p>
Homophonic words are words that are pronounced in the same way as other words but have different meanings, even if they are spelt differently. This can obviously create confusion and unfortunately there are many of these words in English. For example:

<li>they’re – their – there</li>
<li>you’re – your</li>
<li>it’s – its</li>
<li>I – eye</li>
<li>here – hear</li>
<li>break – brake</li>
<li>flower – flour</li>
<li>our – hour</li>
So when you’re writing, be careful to choose the right spelling. And when you listen, remember that a word you think you understood may have another meaning. Try to understand that meaning from the context.
</p>
<h1>3. Use the correct conjugation of the verb </h1>
<p>Remember to change the verb to agree with the subject. The main subjects you need to be careful with are he, she and it because they often have a different form to the others. For example:

<li>She has two cats.  RIGHT</li>

<li>She have two cats. WRONG</li>

This seems like a small mistake to make but unfortunately it’s a very noticeable one. So if you can avoid it, it’ll make a big difference to how accurate you sound.

Remember also that when you describe something using ‘There is/are’, the verb must agree with the first item you mention. For example:

<li>There is a sofa, some chairs and a table.</li>

<li>There are some chairs, a table and a sofa.</li>
</p>
<h1>4. Connect your ideas with conjunctions</h1>
<p>
If you want to connect two ideas or short phrases, you can do so by using a conjunction. For example,

<li>I’m studying English. English is important.

becomes:

I’m studying English because it’s important.

The most common conjunctions are:

<li>and – addition</li>

<li>because – to give the reason </li>

<li>but – to express contrast</li>

<li>so – to describe a consequence</li>

<li>or – to describe an alternative</li>

Here are some examples:

He likes football and he plays in a team.
We’re going out because we’re bored.
She wants to study more but she doesn’t have time.
Kim is coming round so I’m cleaning my flat.
Would you like tea or coffee?
</p>

<h1>5. Sentence construction</h1>
<p>
Generally speaking, sentences in written English are not particularly long. This is good news for English learners because it means you don’t need to worry about writing long, complex sentences. A sentence usually has two, or possibly three, clauses (subject + verb + object), linked by a conjunction (see above).

A good way to make your sentences even clearer is to add commas. Commas help the reader understand where one phrase finishes and another begins. The most common occasions where it’s recommended to put a comma are:

between two clauses. For example, If the weather is nice tomorrow, we’re going to the park.
to separate items in a list. For example, Our kids like swimming, skiing, ice-skating and cycling.
after some conjunctions. For example, Our holiday was great and the hotel was wonderful. However, the weather was awful.
for extra information in the middle of a sentence (a non-defining clause). For example, My neighbor, who’s from Brazil, is really good at cooking.


And don’t forget to start every sentence with a capital letter!
</p>
<h1>6. Remember the word order for questions</h1>
<p>In English, the structure of questions is different to the affirmative form. So make sure you remember to change the order of the words or add the auxiliary ‘do’. There are four ways to make questions in English:

‘to be’ – for questions using the verb ‘to be’, invert the subject and verb. For example, Are you a student?
all other verbs – to make questions for all other verbs, add the auxiliary ‘do’. For example, Do they work here?
modal verbs – to make questions with modal verbs, invert the modal verb and the subject. For example, Can he play the piano?
auxiliary verbs – for sentences containing an auxiliary verb, like ‘’have’ in the present perfect, invert the auxiliary verb and the subject. For example, Have you seen Bob?
 

These rules still apply when you add a question word like what, how, why. For example:

<li>Where are you from?</li>

<li>When can we meet?</li>

<li>Why have they left?</li>
</p>

<h1>7. Use the right past form of verbs</h1>
<p>Speaking about the past in English is not particularly difficult. Every subject uses the same word to express the past, so you don’t have to worry about learning six different words as in some languages. However, many verbs are irregular and don’t follow the regular form of adding -ed. You don’t need to know all of these, but try to learn the most common ones (approximately 20). For example,

<li>Go – went   

Have – had

Make – made</li>

For example,

We went to the cinema last Saturday.
They had a party to celebrate Tom’s birthday.
I made a cake this morning.
</p>

<h1>8. Get familiar with the main English verb tenses</h1>
<p>
If you’re just starting to learn English, you won’t know all the tenses yet. And that’s fine. Just focus on becoming familiar with the four or five that are used most often. Aim to be able to use these:

Present simple – to describe habits and permanent situations. For example, We live in New York.
Present continuous – to describe current situations and future plans. For example, I’m meeting John later.
Past simple – to describe finished past actions. For example, They arrived at 3 p.m.
Present perfect – to describe past actions connected to now. For example, We’ve finished the reports.
Will – to describe future actions. For example, I’ll meet you in front of the conference center.
</p>

<h1>9. Never use a double negative</h1>
<p>In English there are often two ways to express a negative concept. For example, if you want to say the room is empty, you can say:

There is nothing in the room. OR There isn’t anything in the room.

The words ‘nothing’ and ‘anything’ have the same meaning, but ‘nothing’ is used with an affirmative verb, and ‘anything’ is used with a negative verb.

This rule applies to other words like:

<li>nobody – anybody</li>

<li>none – any</li>

This is also true of the word ‘never’ when you talk about experience. You can say:

He’s never been to the U.S. OR He hasn’t ever been to the U.S.

The meaning is the same but in the second sentence the use of ‘ever’ means you need to make the verb negative.

Learning all these grammar rules obviously takes time and you also need some guidance to be able to put them into practice. The best way to become confident and proficient in using them is to practice in a supportive and fun environment with experienced teachers. Find out more about Our Method now.

<h1>The 11 Rules of Grammar: Understand the Basics</h1>
    It seems like English grammar has about a million rules to learn. Between subject-verb agreement, Oxford commas, and active vs. passive voice, it’s easy to get lost in the grammar shuffle. But there aren’t actually a million grammar rules — in fact, if you master just these few, you can avoid common grammar mistakes.</h1>
<p><h1>1. Write in Complete Sentences
Every sentence needs two parts to be complete.</h1>

<li>a subject (Katie plays the violin.)</li>
<li>a verb (Katie plays the violin.)</li>
Depending on the verb, a complete sentence — also known as an independent clause — might also have a direct object (Katie plays the violin). If your sentence is missing a subject or a verb, it’s a sentence fragment.</p>
<h1>2. Make Sure Your Subjects and Verbs Agree</h1>
<p>You may not expect to find disagreement in a sentence about kittens, but the sentence “My kittens wants food” is definitely having an argument with itself. The subject (kittens) is plural, but the verb (wants) is singular.

For subject-verb agreement, match singular subjects to singular verbs and plural subjects to plural verbs.

<li>My kitten wants food. (singular subject, singular verb)</li>
<li>My kittens want food. (plural subject, plural verb)</li>
</p>
<h1>3. Link Ideas With a Conjunction or Semicolon</h1>
<p>
Although writing in simple sentences is grammatically correct, it’s not very interesting. Combine your simple sentences with coordinating conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) to make compound sentences.

Delia found a cat, and she named it Purdy.
Our team won the championship, so we got a trophy.
You can also mix it up by using a semicolon instead of a conjunction.

<li>Delia found a cat; she named it Purdy.</li>
<li>Our team won the championship; we got a trophy.</li></p>
<h1>4. Use Commas Correctly</h1>
<p>While you can use a comma with a coordinating conjunction, you can’t use a comma alone to combine independent clauses. That’s an error known as a comma splice, and it creates run-on sentences. Use a comma only if you’re also using a coordinating conjunction.

<li>Delia found a cat, she named it Purdy. (Incorrect - comma splice)</li>
<li>Our team won the championship, and we got a trophy. (Correct - with coordinating conjunction)</li></p>
<h1>5. Use a Serial Comma When Necessary</h1>
<p>
When listing items in a sentence, you separate them with commas. The last comma in the series is called the Oxford comma, and not everyone likes it.

<li>We bought some goats, cows, and horses for our farm. (Oxford comma)</li>
<li>We bought some goats, cows and horses for our farm. (No Oxford comma)</li>
Whether you regularly use an Oxford comma is up to you and your style guide. However, you should always use an Oxford comma when the sentence could be confusing without it.

<li>The farmer saw the goats, Gil, and Pierre. (Oxford comma clarifies that there are goats and two people named Gil and Pierre)</li>
<li>The farmer saw the goats, Gil and Pierre. (No Oxford comma makes it sound like the goats are named Gil and Pierre)</li>
</p>
<h1>6. Use Active Voice</h1>
<p>Sentences in active voice put the subject before the verb. For example, in the active sentence “The duck ate the bread,” the duck is the subject. It performs the action in the verb (ate) to the object in the sentence (the bread).

In these examples, the subjects are bold, the verbs are underlined, and the objects are italicized.

<li>Shelby dried the dishes. (Active — Shelby is the subject)</li>
<li>Mary walked the dog. (Active — Mary is the subject)</li>
Passive voice sentences place the subject after the verb — or they leave the subject out completely. “The bread was eaten by the duck” is a passive sentence because the subject (the duck) comes after the verb (was eaten). The object of the sentence (the bread) somehow ends up at the beginning of the sentence, which makes it confusing to read.

<li>The dishes were dried by Shelby. (Passive — the subject is after the verb)</li>
<li>The dog was walked by Mary. (Passive - the subject is missing)</li>
Writing in passive voice makes your sentences confusing and your meaning unclear. Luckily, it’s easy to turn passive voice into active voice.
</p>
<h1>7. Use the Correct Verb Tense</h1>
<p>Using a verb tense that doesn’t match your time period is like stepping into a broken time machine. When did the action happen — today, tomorrow, or one hundred years ago? Is it still happening? 

Make sure that you’ve got the correct tense for the time period you’re describing.

<li>Present tense - something that happens all the time, or is happening right now (Mary and I eat lunch every Tuesday.)</li>
<li>Past tense - something that happened before now (Mary and I ate lunch.)</li>
<li>Future tense - something that will happen in the future (Mary and I will eat lunch.)</li>
When talking about a continuous action, you can use present, past, or future progressive tense (with -ing verb endings). If you’re talking about something that happened across a span of time, use perfect verb tenses (with the modal verb have or had).
</p>
<h1>8. Keep Your Verb Tense Consistent</h1>
<p>Another part of using the correct verb tense concerns consistency. If you start your sentence (or paragraph, or page, or book) in one tense, you need to make sure the rest of your writing is also in that tense. You can go back and forth if you’re talking about different time periods, but be careful not to mix them up.

<li>Incorrect - Stuart lost his wallet. He goes to the bank and gets some cash, then he went to the restaurant. (The tense goes from past to present, back to past again)</li>
<li>Correct - Stuart lost his wallet. He went to the bank and got some cash, then he went to the restaurant. (Tense stays in the past)</li>
<li>Correct - Stuart loses his wallet. He goes to the bank and gets some cash, then he goes to the restaurant. (Tense stays in the present)</li>
</p>
<h1>9. Only Use Apostrophes for Possessive Nouns and </h1>
<p>
Many people use apostrophes in plural nouns because — well, we’re not sure why. Apostrophes note when letters are missing in a contraction and they indicate a singular or plural noun’s possession. Those are the only jobs of an apostrophe. 

<li>Correct - Xander can’t wait until summer vacation. (can’t is a contraction of cannot)</li>
<li>Correct - Did you borrow the neighbor’s car? (neighbor’s is a possessive noun)</li>
<li>Correct - This is the writers' room. (writers’ is a plural possessive noun)</li>
<li>Incorrect - Merry Christmas from the Henderson’s! (Hendersons is plural, not possessive)</li>
The rare time you’d use an apostrophe to show plurals is for plural lowercase letters (as in “Mind your p’s and q’s”). Otherwise, keep them away from your plural nouns.
</p>
<h1>10. Keep Your Homophones Straight</h1>
<p>
Using too when you mean to is a common — and avoidable — mistake. Make sure you know the difference between common homophones to keep your meaning clear.

<li>two vs. to vs too</li>
<li>your vs. you’re</li>
<li>there vs. their vs. they’re</li>
<li>except vs. accept</li>
<li>then vs. than</li>
These aren’t the only commonly confused words in English. Find the ones that confuse you the most and learn how to tell them apart.
</p>
<h1>11. Use End Punctuation Correctly</h1>
<p>
All good things must come to an end, and that includes your sentence. Be sure that you’re using the correct end punctuation mark for your sentence for the tone you want.

<li>Period - Paul asked Sadie to the dance. (Serious or neutral tone)</li>
<li>Question mark - Paul asked Sadie to the dance? (Confused tone)</li>
<li>Exclamation point - Paul asked Sadie to the dance! (Excited tone)</li>

<h1><br>10 Easy Ways to Improve Your Vocabulary Skills</h1>
<p>
You can try these ideas to build your vocabulary:

<h1>1. Learn the roots of words</h1>
To build a strong foundation for your vocabulary, it’s helpful to understand the roots of words. Many words have a common root and a prefix or suffix that helps you determine what the meaning might be. For example, when a word includes the root “duc,” a Latin word that means “to make or lead,” you can assume that the root refers to that Latin definition. You’ll see this root in words like “produce” or “deduce.”

<h1>2. Focus on practical terms and words</h1>
Some industries have different definitions for words or use entirely new words, which is called jargon. If your coworkers and others in your field use technical jargon, try focusing on building your vocabulary to incorporate these words. For example, some industries use the word “stand-up” to mean a short daily meeting.

You can also look for clearer ways to express yourself instead of relying on cliches that may be difficult for others to understand or skew your meaning. For example, instead of saying “get your foot in the door,” you could use “expand your opportunities.”

<h1>3. Create word associations</h1>
Word associations can help you remember certain words or phrases. For example, the word “gargantuan” means very large. Try creating a sequence with the word, such as tiny, small, medium, large, giant and gargantuan. Forming associations can help you recall words you’re learning with more ease. These associations can also ensure you remember the word long term.

<h1>4. Complete regular vocabulary tests</h1>
At the end of each week, create a quiz that includes the vocabulary words, root words or other language aspects that you’ve been studying. Taking a quiz or test can increase your ability to retain new words. Every time you learn a new root or word, create a flashcard. On one side of the card, write the word, and on the opposite side, write the definition. You can practice recalling the definition from the words and vice versa.

<h1>5. Take a writing class</h1>
As you build your vocabulary, you can also improve your writing skills, which will benefit you in your professional life. Take a writing course online or at a local adult educational institution that incorporates assignments and tests to help you boost your ability to communicate effectively through writing. If you complete a writing class, take notes on any new words you learn throughout the course.

<h1>6. Create groups of words</h1>
As you learn new words, you can group them together by meaning. By creating these groups, you can identify patterns that make it easier to incorporate the words into your daily speech. For example, you might learn words like affirmative, efficacious and decisive, which all mean positive. By grouping these words together, it becomes easier to recall their general meanings and how to use them in speech.

<h1>7. Identify word nuances</h1>
Some words have alternate definitions in different contexts. An example of nuance is the word “frame,” which could have several meanings depending on the scenario. A frame could be a border that surrounds a picture or window, or it could mean to outline or highlight a certain physical quality. Identifying and understanding these nuances in language will help you better know how to use the words you’ve learned in your communication with others.

<h1>8. Identify words that share meanings</h1>
Different words often share the same or similar meaning. You can create a list of word groups to help you construct new and unique statements in your writing and speech. Some words have similar meanings but don’t always substitute for one another, so it’s helpful to review definitions of similar words before using them. By varying the word choices in your communication, you’ll sound more polished and professional.

<h1>9. Diversify what you read</h1>
Most people spend at least some of their time reading every day. Diversifying your reading choices can help you build a stronger vocabulary since you see new words from different writers who have varying writing patterns. Adding new texts and options to your reading list can also help.

<h1>10. Edit what you write</h1>
When you finish writing any professional text, such as an email or cover letter, review your content for repetitive words or phrases. Consider using your expanded vocabulary to replace words you used frequently throughout the document. By editing your own writing, you can improve clarity, style and tone.
